# wetpy
wetpy is a high level package that aims to simplify the access to water resourse data such as USGS streamflow, NCDC Integrated Surface Data, Global Historic Climate Network Data, and US Climate reference network data and to provide spatial analysis tools.

The base code for this project is in the process of being ported over from a local network to favor actively downloading files as needed versus requiring the enitirely of datasets to be stored locally. (ISH dataset alone is roughly 680GB)
